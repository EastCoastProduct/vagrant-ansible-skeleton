# vagrant-ansible-skeleton
The purpose of this repository is to provide simple way to get started with developing application inside Virtual Machine. This sets up VM with installed NodeJS. There is also a sample application that its configured to run with. That is easy editable to actually include your nodejs application that will be run under supervisor.

This is working with our express-api-skeleton. You need to clone both repos under same directory and then it will provision VM with express-api-skeleton app running on it under supervisor.

You can easily replace express-api-skeleton with whatever application to run.

Prerequisites for this to run are:

* Vagrant
* VirtualBox
* Ansible
